## What is Ansible

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications inside containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that encapsulate the application code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings required to run the application. Docker provides a standardized way to package and distribute applications, allowing developers to build, ship, and run their applications seamlessly across different environments, from development to production. With Docker, developers can create isolated environments for their applications, ensuring consistency and reliability across various infrastructure platforms, whether it's on-premises, in the cloud, or hybrid environments.

## Step 1 - Creating and Installing Docker

```
snap install docker
```
